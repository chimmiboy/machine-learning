"0","2024-09-17","OTHER","4","Having some difficulty with walking and standing around, we decided that the best way to see as many college buildings as possible was to go on the city bus tour, and so it proved to be. So much to see, we stayed on the bus for two and a half laps and thoroughly  enjoyed all we saw, we then used our last lap as a hop on/hop off experience.
It is in our opinion, the best way to see all the University campus's as well as being informed via the provided headsets.
Well worth doing, highly recommended.","Fabulous Buildings and Architecture","COUPLES"

There are normally two tour each day, but sometimes a group monopolise one tour, so you might not get your first choice of free tour.. Arrriving at the OUP building, the reception area was so pleasant that part of me wished that I had been arriving for a job interview, and hoping for success. After a short wait, a helpful and pleasant young woman arrived to conduct my tour. I spent about an hour there. The museum concerns the history of printing and book selling , particularly in Oxford,by means of wall displays, and cases. There is also a section about words, where visitors are invited to select their favourite word,. My guide explained that there is a programme of annual school visits, to invite children to choose too. The press has an extensive archive, and the guides are drawn from the archivists. Unfortunately the case lighting brought on a migraine, and I spent the afternoon in bed, so beware, if you suffer from migraines. A worthwhile visit, nevertheless.","Oxford University Press Museum","SOLO"

去程：London Paddington or London Marylebone. The round trip should cost about £24. If you want to save some money, you can buy a railcard on Trainpal and enter the code RC777E for a 20% discount—enough to save you the price of a gelato, haha!

Return trip: If you've bought an off-peak day return for any route on the high-speed train, you can take the Oxford → Marylebone route and get off at Bicester Village for some shopping.

Once you exit Oxford Station, it's about a 15-minute walk to reach the area near Oxford University.

The University itself is comprised of 39 constituent colleges (including Merton), and are scattered, more or less near each other in the city center. The three dining halls of those I was able to tour (Merton, Pembroke and Christ Church colleges) all are immediately reminiscent of the dining hall at Hogwarts in the harry Potter movies. The architecture of all but a couple are old and very impressive, as are the Bodleian Library, Ashmolean Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum.  I attended a very nice Evensong at Christ Church College's cathedral, and spent a few evenings several of the ancient local pubs., several of which are owned by the University.

"0","2023-04-17","OTHER","5","Oxford is of course extremely famous but it is also a very interesting university to visit and is in fact a huge tourist attraction because of both its fame and its many buildings and colleges.

Te university is intertwined with, and spread throughout, the urban fabric of Oxford.  Colleges, man of which include several buildings, are spread throughout the town and are, at certain times of the year, open to visit.  Other buildings to visit include the Bodleian Library, the University Church of St Mary and its tower, which visitors may climb, and Magdalene Tower.  Some places, like the iconic Radcliffe Camera are not open to the general public but may be seen from the outside.  There also also parks and recreation grounds and areas with footpaths along the River Cherwell.

Numerous locations in the university, such as the Radcliffe Camera and several colleges, appear frequently in the Morse-Lewis-Endeavour shows as well and one can look up which ones appeared in which episodes, or visit these on tours.  There is a lot to see and seeing even a significant portion would require several days.  That said, it is all basically walkable in central Oxford.

One should be prepared for the university to be very busy with visitors and when regular terms are not in session, there are often groups of visiting students and tour groups all over the place.","Magnificent and Interesting University","NONE"

You come to Oxford to see the University and the 39 separate colleges that comprise it.  Even things like the great museums and churches are here because of the University.  

This is the oldest college and university in the English speaking world and every other college and and university emulates it in some way.  In Oxford, England, they are very proud of their history as the place where cows could cross the Thames.  However, there are dozens of Oxford cities in the English speaking world and none are associated with cow crossings, but they all have colleges and students.  Visit any American university or college and you will find strong academic buildings on beautiful, lush quadrangles and where did they get these ideas, Oxford.

You can't be in Oxford, England and not see the colleges in some way.  With that said they do manifest themselves in the best way in a couple of locations.  An absolute MUST SEE in Oxford is Radcliffe Square where you will see the oldest buildings like the Bodleian library, the most amazing buildings like the Radcliffe Camera, the prettiest buildings like All Soul's College and the communal university center University Church St. Mary's.  I think a close second is Christ Church College where you can see so much in one college.  At either you will see the place where 30 English Prime Ministers attended, 73 Nobel Prize laureates have been and 110 Olympic medals were made.  You will see history where Kings have clashed, bishops were burned and some of the most important works of English literature were inspired.

Christ Church College is one of the popular ones, if not the most popular, and you can book tickets on line. Divinity School is also popular and tickets are hard to get. Most dining halls are closed to visitors during lunch hours, so plan your visit. Accommodations can be costly and availability is limited in Oxford, so look for the surrounding areas and take the train in. We stayed in Reading (nicest train station in the UK) and took the train in (25 min ride). Some colleges offer accommodations when school is out, so check their websites for information.

The history of this University town and its colleges are well documented in books,films and guides and it is a must for every tourist who visits England.
Each college boasts of its age, ancestry and beauty and no one can argue that this does not hold merit. The numerous photographs of Oxford vistas and colleges particularly the striking dome of Radcliffe Camera, the Magdalen Deer Park, Christ Church meadows, Balliol Chapel ,
Hertford Bridge, Bodleian Library and the adjacent Sheldonian Theatre etc. The list could go on and this ‘city of dreaming spires’
had an ethereal feel to it.
The narrative of famous people who went to Oxford in the 19th and 20th centuries is endless - Stephen Hawking,WH Auden,Albert Einstein,TE Lawrence,VS Naipaul,Roger Bannister,Margaret Thatcher,Adam Smith,JRR Tolkien .

There was a range of exhibits that were attractively displayed and well labelled without excessive off-putting detail. They were within every family's life experience, and visitors were generally encouraged to touch items.

Now it has several hundred MBA students alone from all over the world undertaking a one year course with extended 10-week terms and projects overseas in between. After assembling in an atrium resembling an airport terminal we were taken to see the large Nelson Mandela theatre so named because that well known businessman and entrepreneur himself opened it. Then to a Harvard style lecture theatre so called because built in the round to encourage live discussion and debate. Then into a courtyard where drinks were being laid out for a reception for recent graduates before progressing into the newer Thatcher building past rows of Patrick Caulfield prints on floors of Italian marble up to the senior common room (portrait of his mother apparently flogged by Mark Thatcher within days of her death; two Joe Tilson prints on the rear wall), where we were told this area was used by mature students already at executive level in business willing to pay up to £18,000.00 per week to study here.

"3","2018-08-08","OTHER","5","The University is not a single place, it is an institution composed of 38 colleges and university buildings across the city of Oxford, You will not see all of it in one visit, so see how much time you have and use it accordingly. For a brief visit, head for Radcliffe Square, the heart of the University, where you can visit St Marys church, the place where students were first taught. There is no fee to enter, though it is worth paying to ascend the tower, with its marvellous views of the city. It is also free to visit All Souls College, just off the square, in the afternoons. 

The Square is dominated by the Radcliffe Camera, a reading room of the Bodleian Library, which you cannot enter, but you can visit other parts of the Library, on the north side of the square. Here you will also find the Sheldonian Theatre, where graduations have taken place since it was built in 1669. Before that, graduations were held at St Marys. 

If you have time, visit one or two of the colleges. Christchurch is popular, for its grandeur and Harry Potter associations, and you will have to pay an entrance fee and share the college with crowds of visitors. You can also visit Oxford's cathedral, located in the college and well worth the visit. Christchurch Meadows are also lovely.

Two other colleges well worth a visit are New College and Magdalen, both of which will charge you an entrance fee. New College has a most beautiful cloister and chapel and an impressive part of the old town wall. Magdalen is notable also for its cloister, and its extensive gardens, full of wild flowers in the Spring.

Oxford University is considered one of the most weighty academic institutions in the world. Though the exact date of establishment remains unclear, there is evidence that Oxford teaching has beginnings in the XI century. The university had a drastic increase since 1167, when King Henry II stopped English students from going to the University of Paris.Most of Oxford's teaching is organized around ""Tutorials"", which are weekly essay-based discussions that take place within the self-governing colleges that make up the University.

"4","2018-01-04","OTHER","4","The University area of Oxford consists of many Colleges, autonomous units within the University. The colleges have buildings of their own, with halls, libraries, churches, everything within the college walls. The oldest buildings are medieval and the style of newer ones has been kept the same: There is unreasonable amount of beauty in the decorated facades, cloisters, hallways. There are parts of the campus area where you could almost shoot a photograph blindfolded in random direction and be guaranteed to have a postcard quality image as a result.

We took a guided tour and would recommend one to anyone visiting Oxford for the first time. The location of the Colleges is confusing and there are so many of them one can't visit them all. It's good to have someone tell where to go next. Also, the amnout of history and stories behind every building is stupefying. Best to have someone whi can help you into it before you get dizzy on your own. Our tour was from London, International Friends, with an excellent guide we can highly recommend.

We walked by many famous Colleges, Trinity, All Souls, Christ Church, and the Sheldonian Theatre, Bodleian Library, Radcliffe Camera and the University Church. After the walk we had only a short time to have lunch and visit inside colleges. This is where it gets confusing since colleges have different and irregular visiting hours and they charge individual entrance fees, some of them more than just a couple of pounds. The most popular attractions get busy soon and you may not fit in, at least not in time.

I can recommend the downstairs room of Bodleian Library that costs just one pound to visit and after a couple of minutes in the stunning beauty of it you can proceed your walk. The New college has a beautiful cloister, one of the many Hatty Potter filming locations in Oxford. The University Church is also very nice and has a small cafe/bar in its gardens. What we would have liked to do was to visit the belltower, but the queue was too long. But we managed to visit the small Science museum, free of charge.

"1","2017-10-09","MOBILE","4","So this place is yet another marvelous piece of architecture amongst an endless supply of amazing architecture found in and the surrounding areas of London. Located about one hour and twenty minutes outside of London the best way to visit here is to book a tour where this is one of the stops. It's a bit much to do a two and a half hour plus round trip just for this one stop. We booked a tour with one of the many touring companies that had Oxford, Costwolds, Stratford-upon-Avon and Detailed Castle with Viator. That maid it a fantastic day trip where we got to see a castle, this legendary school which was also used as location for parts of Hogwarts in the Harry Potter movies but we also go to visit the town and house where none other than mr. William Shakespeare was born. A lot of people will tell you that it's a waste of money booking the stores through companies like theater but for me and my girlfriend were able to book amazing excursions and Adventures for our trip and we did it all in one day. We set down search for things to do in London on TripAdvisor went down the list pics the ones that we like and we booked them. It was easy and I recommend that if your booking multiple excursions that you call them and do it over the phone because you will qualify for 5% savings. It might not seem like much but we saved $50 just for doing it over the phone because we booked enough excursions to qualify for the discount. So if you have the time to research all of this individually and booked through all of these companies one by one and so forth by all means go ahead but if you want your vacation to be painless stress free and not consume weeks at a time to plan then just save yourself the hassle ","Another Harry Potter Site ","COUPLES"

The card system sometimes tripped me up if I wasn't careful and accidently left behind my card in my room, but I got around this quite easily and it usually wasn't a problem.

I would had liked to see the rest of the campus but large parts of it were closed off to people in my program for that summer, the parts I did see were quite impressive on their own so all is well. 

I very much loved your great chestnut tree near that building I think was next to the Earl Residence. It had an otherworldly feel to it and I felt that it was inhabited by a nature spirit (I am not convinced that supernatural beings really do exist but I wish they did). 

Would had liked it if more of the original buildings were still standing ... Oh well, I guess places just evolve over a thousand years.

Each one of these individual colleges were originally sponsored / built by some wealthy family and all have different names (religion / Clamford / etc.) and range in size from small to large with large being about the size of a High School building (but much older looking) back home, but graduates emphasis the general term OXFORD on their resume’s as a point of study.   
There are about 2,300 students total in all the 38 colleges (54% male students / 46% female students).

There are regular trains from Paddington and a fast train can get you there in under an hour. Plan to arrive around 9am if you are able and maybe have your evening meal there as there are many good pubs and restaurants. All the main sites are within walking distance from the station which is only about 10 minutes walk from the centre of town. I suggest getting a map before you arrive and working out what you want to see and a route ahead of arriving.  The botanic gardens is probably not worth seeing this late in the year. If you want to experience punting pay to hire a professional. If you want to see inside a college I would go for Worcester as it is free and the gardens are possibly the best kept plus the Quad and its lawn is fabulous. Do not miss the chapel there either. It is open from 2pm to 5pm. In terms of museums the Ashmoleum is fabulous but huge. I like the Museum of the History of Science as it is small, interesting and unique. I also like the small local history museum in the Town Hall. Do not miss the free exhibitions at The New Bodleian. The Covered Market is great for half and hour and maybe a cheap lunch. Do not bother with climbing Carfax Tower as the view is not up to much. Walking through Christchurch Meadow is a lovely way to spend a few minutes with lovely views. Other than that I would wander around the back lanes alongside the Sheldonian Theatre and the Bridge of Sighs and look at the buildings along the High Street and Broad Street.

As to some tips. Be prepared to do a lot of walking as if you use a car or bus. Otherwise you will not get the whole experience of going there. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful to this old duffer.

NOW FOR SOME HINTS

Hire a private guide I found one at the local pub. They usually are a font of School Info. Also she charged what I thought was a very reasonable fee. (NO she was not a H**ker ! So get your mind out of the gutter!)

Go during the off season as the place is very crowded during the Tourist season. 

Also parking can be a nightmare. 

Listen in one some of the conversations as you will be amazed by the huge range of conversation that you will hear there.

The campus and town is beautiful and the architecture is amazing. Every turn showcases another elaborate building or garden. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and pubs to choose from.

The main issue with Oxford was that everything seemed to be behind a different paywall. We were taken to the library as part of the walking tour, but were then turned away because we hadn't paid for admission. Our tour guide was very surprised by this, so maybe that is a new policy? Also, Oxford is home to many different locations that were used during the filming of the Harry Potter movies, but go figure, each is behind a different paywall. The only other negative is the cobblestone streets/sidewalks. If you aren't incredibly focused on your walking, you are likely to twist an ankle at the very least. A woman in our tour group was incredibly close to having a major fall.

This was a really cool place to visit and I am glad that I got to see it. If you are pressed for time on your vacation, I would say that you could skip this location and not miss out on anything major. If you have some extra time, or are a big Harry Potter fan, this might be a good way to spend the afternoon.","Amazing Architecture","COUPLES"

We visited both campuses during a fairly long 10 hour day and although rushed at times, the trip was well worth it. The Oxford University campus, with its various colleges and cathedrals as well as other buildings in the city of oxford are simply amazing and most memorable. It is not very often that one gets to see and walk through academic buildings that are over 1000 years old! As an academic, I have been through most of the major University campuses in the USA and many are very beautiful. But Oxford is in a class by itself. No wonder they can charge an admission to walk through the campus just to admire the architecture.On the  day when we visited,it was also the graduation day at Oxford ,so we saw numerous new graduates dressed up in their cap and gown walking proudly among the throng of tourist . It reminded us that this is a working University, not just a magnificent ancient campus. Certainly worth the all day visit to two of the greatest places of learning in the world, Oxford and Cambridge.

It would have been a really great experience but here is the problem that no one raises in their review: every single thing is charged in this city.

You see a beautiful botanic park, you can't go in without paying for it. You see a beautiful building, you can't go in without paying, and so on and so on.

I wanted to visit the places in which Harry Potter was shot, but since it is part of the University, it gives you the impression that they don't want you in. Everything was close or close to visitors, you could literally go nowhere, or just have a look around at the entrance or the principal courtyard. 
If you don't want to pay, you will not see anything.

I wanted to go and see in Christ Church as well, but it closed at 4.15pm, so be careful, don't come too late. Also, the famous stare of Harry Potter was closed for the visitors as well.

The only thing that was free was the Natural History Museum, and it was worth it; it was really interesting and had a collection of items from all over the world ! 

To sum up, the city would deserve a better mark but I am so disappointing because it became a tourist trap, and every shop is double the price as well. 

It is a pity, because it could be interesting but as for the University, it feels like visitors are not really welcome.

"0","2016-09-14","MOBILE","3","This review relates to Christchurch College and the Cathedral - in essence one.
No doubting that the architecture is outstanding, but do remember that as far as the College is concerned you don't get to see much indoors. The dining Hall is the principal interior. Its claim to fame being that it was used for Hogwarts in Harry Potter, EXCEPT, as a staff member told me, they found it too small and recreated it in the studio. Also, you only get to shuffle round in a slow 'conga' line to gawp at old wood and numerous portraits beyond the rope barriers.
The cathedral is the main point of interest, with greater freedom of movement. A mildly interesting, if small, interior. Nothing to write home about in comparison to some of the great Anglican cathedrals.
My main beef is the price of entry. Six pounds for a senior citizen, and not a great deal to see. Also, I find it offensive to make a MANDATORY charge to enter the House of God. Some other cathedrals do this, but most proffer a suggested fee/donation and some are free. I always give something ( I don't expect anything for nothing). Maintenance costs must be horrendous. To add insult to injury, to get into the Picture Gallery, which is within the college precincts, it is another two pounds (a concessionary price based upon your earlier ticket purchase). Eight pounds, in total, isn't really a lot, but this is just one location, and if you wish to visit a number of colleges repeated admission fees add up.
I did enjoy the experience, but just that miffed feeling of being slightly ripped off.","Hmmm?","FRIENDS"

A collection of colleges and libraries with lots of the gardens, quads and treasures hidden from view, it can be hard to get hold of somehow. I'd recommend  a walking tour, either self guided or with a guide free or otherwise from Broad Street. Visiting the Bodleian Library gets you to the heart of what the library is all about. You can pay to visit the oldest sections that are still in use every day (and were used in Harry Potter films!) it's a good place to start and the Weston Library building on Broad Street has excellent free displays of library treasures and a good cafe. Scholars belong to colleges where the I've, eat and study together. College wise Christ Church has to be the most impressive with 12th century monastic buildings, superb if compact Cathedral, amazing Dining Hall, where kings and queens of England from Henry Vlll to Elizabeth ll have all dined at High Table, to the great Tom Quad, the largest in Oxford and out via Peckwater and Canterbury Quads. There is even Picture Gallery with a splendid collection of old masters and drawings. You have to pay via the Meadow Gate (walks round river meadows withrowers and good views back), but you can visit the Cathedral for free, and walk through Tom Quad by coming to the 6pm Evensong service each day. Entrance via Tom Gate from 5.45, often with the world class choir the service lasts about 50 mins. If you don't want to pay to do a college visit I'd recommend visiting colleges in the afternoon like Worcester College, St Johns or Exeter that don't usually charge. Round the day off with a view from a tower, Carfax, St Michael on Cornmarket, or, for the best view, St Mary the Virgin on High Street/Radcliffe Square, and a nice coffee in the historic Vaults, or Museum of Modern Art or anywhere else that takes your fancy.

At the risk of sounding philosophical the university is everywhere and no where. Essentially it consists of a large collection of quite independent colleges, some centrally organised admin and lab facilities and a collection of world beating libraries and museums so to attempt to review the university as a single entity is bound to fail. Suffice it to say that Oxford with its combination of ancient institutions and traditions, fabulous architecture and superb museums is one of the world's great locations and the best advice i can possibly give to visitors is simply to relax, wonder round and take things as they come, just soak it all up","This is a slightly Crazy Subject","BUSINESS"
"2","2016-09-13","OTHER","5","Once described (I think in 'Europe on Five Dollars a Day') as a good stop over between London and Stratford upon Avon, Oxford has delights which might last most visitors for a life time.   Not only are there 'the colleges' - steeped in history and each containing outward charm and hidden beauties - but there are several modern buildings which are among the most beautiful in the world.   Both the wonderful Blavatnik building in Walton Street and the Weston building in Broad Street have been shortlisted for the prestigious Stirling prize for modern architecture.  And the recently refurbished Ashmolean is now among the nation's finest small museums.  And then there are the not-to-be missed Natural History and Pitt Rivers museums.
  If you are planning to spend just a day or two in Oxford, I would recommend visits to Worcester College and its wonderful lake and gardens (a few minutes walk from the railway station), and  St John's College, New College and Magdalen - all fairly central.   
     Any socially aware visitor must - in the year 2016 - ask the question:  what do undergraduates do to deserve an education in a place of such privilege and such beauty?  And, even more pertinently, what should be the obligations of this privileged few be  to posterity?   Alas.  Too many - having won their glittering prize (a place at an Oxford College) - are not tempted by education or  social well fare  or even 'politics'  and  after graduation seek for more 'glitter' in the city.
    Oxford has many pleasant bars and 'eating houses' of a variety of kinds - but-  alas it has no great restaurant.","The best of the old and the best of the new","COUPLES"

Many of the colleges are built in a local stone which seem sto glow at certain times of the day an dis especially lovely in Autumn sunlight.

If you wish to enter the colleges sometimes they are free to visit and sometimes they charge a fee

Many of the colleges have interesting nooks and crannies to explore such as hidden back quads, cloisters and gardens - one college (Magdalen) has its own deer park!

Some colleges charge an entrance fee for guided tours, others are only open in very small windows during the day and yet others seem to have closed entirely to public access, probably because the number of visitors and tourists have multiplied in recent years and the poor students need some privacy. Another way to visit it to spot for frequent musical recitals in the chapels or to attend the evensongs in the College Chapels which often offer fabulous choir music and soothing church rituals - a much needed break from the busy outside life. At any rate, if you can make it inside in one way or the other the experience will remain with you forever, so highly recommended.","World class sightseeing","FAMILY"

"3","2016-04-02","MOBILE","5","How often does one get to step into such a prestigious academic institution such as Oxford? For me, I was totally awed and humbled when I entered the University grounds. Such beautiful aged architecture from the 12th century, which due to wars and insensible destruction by monarchs, brought about rebuilding and modernisation by many who walked through its corridors and wanted to ensure this great place would be kept open for future generations. Knowledge enlightens the human mind and Oxford was, and still is, a fountain of knowledge to all who have had the privilege of being educated there. 

The only reason I wanted to see this place was because my son hopes, wishes to go there some day. To him, I say: work hard to get there as not anyone or everyone is allowed to enter. 

I was with my bestie and her hubby. We went to the information centre before 10 am, booked on the 11am guided walking tour which takes about 2 hours. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes and not heels or slippers, there are many cobbled streets around Oxford. These add to the old world charm and make it even more quaint. There are several types of walking tours so take a pick, but we decided to go for the general university tour. The guide was great and she provided little additional tidbits for those who were Inspector Morse fans or Alice in Wonderland readers. Just the age of these buildings will make you shake your heads in disbelief! 

Did you know 13 PMs of UK have passed through Oxford, including Mr David Cameron? Also, Tolkien, CS Lewis and other great writers have taught in the various colleges. 

I must stop rambling. Suggest that you park your car closest to the university near a pub called the Brakspear. It is Pay parking so make sure you give yourself at least 5-6 hours because there is so much to see and places to walk around, soak in the atmosphere, feel the ghosts of students and teachers past walk with you. There are many many shops so dont buy in a hurry as similar items may be cheaper in other stores. Just stroll at leisure. Lots of cafes and restaurants and pubs to try out. 

Enjoy, because I really did. Thanks to my wonderful friend who took me there! Another place ticked off my bucket list.

"0","2015-11-11","OTHER","4","The university is really a collection of individual colleges often of great historical and architectural merit built chiefly to the east and south east of Carfax, a classic 'compass points' crossroads marking out the centre of the city.  

The lower-lying land to the west is where the oxen-crossing-the-ford concept belongs not up on the higher land where the colleges are.  As well as a university there are splendid museums - Ashmolean, University and Pitt Rivers to name but three and because of the course of the rivers Thames and Cherwell, there are green fingers extending right into the main urban areas.  

Although it is only possible to climb a couple of church towers it is worth doing this to see the prominent older buildings and rather miraculously much of the newer city and the extensive eastern suburbs disappear in the trees and folds of the land.  There is however a BMW car plant building the Mini only 5 miles to the east!

Personally I find it much better laid out as an ancient settlement than Cambridge.  If visiting the UK and coming here for the first time, there are incredibly frequent, high quality coach services from central London stops as well as two distinct rail services.  If time is limited I would suggest forgoing a visit to Blenheim Palace and Woodstock and concentrate on the city.

It is every bit as picturesque and dramatic as it is captured on film. Being there, you actually appreciate the scale of these wonderful classic monuments. 

To think that so many great minds emerged from the corridors of these colleges, it is even more awe-inspiring.

Many of the buildings are not open to the public but there is so much to see, you probably can't fit it all in on one day anyway.

There are some interesting small businesses around the University, e.g. traditional book binders and, of course, handmade Oxford shoes shops. There are always some activities going on inside the city... someone singing opera, someone playing the cello ... all very serene.

I have explored the campuses of Harvard, M.I.T., Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Rutgers, College of William and Mary,  University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech.  The combined campuses of these American universities cannot hold a candle to Oxford.

The beauty, splendor, and history of the university and village take my breath away.  My eyes 
cannot absorb and feet cannot move fast enough as churches, buildings, shops, quads, alleyways, and streets, unfold.  They cannot be duplicated.  This is a university?  

It is unreal.  Oxford seems more like a scene from a movie set or television series or story books.  Where is my Prince Charming on his white horse to carry me off?  Where is my golden carriage that magically changes from a pumpkin?  I will even settle for Rumpelstiltskin!

I sit on a bench in an English garden at the university.  Mesmerized and soothed by the quiet, stillness, unusual flowers, and pristine garden, I do not want to let go of the afternoon.  Solitary with no one or noise to break the silence, it is tranquil.  I wish and pray for this peace to visit every human being on this earth.

The Bodleian Library imposes in physical building and contents.  It is one of the oldest library in the world.  It has an original script of the Magna Carta and the original manuscript of the ""Wind in the Willows.""  Groups of tourists are lectured and taken by hand to explore.

I touch the walls of the buildings on various campuses to ensure that they are real.  I take many photos to prove that I am here.

It is free entrance to the Museum of Natural History.   Lots of animal bones and Pitts' junk from his attic!  Many high school groups with bored students too.  

If I can go back in time, I should have been a more serious and industrious student.  I should not have squandered my youth.  I would give my left arm to attend this awesome university.  Who knew such a place existed?  Oxford University inspires.  

On the other hand, there are also many distractions to keep a student from staying focused.  Besides the university, there is a beautiful village/town.  It is easy walking.  The canal is picturesque.  Picnics come to mind.  A Rhodes scholar hungering for home-cooked food used to relax there with fried chicken lunches brought by his family on Sundays. 

The Oxford University Press has a store front on one of the main streets.  Millions of books are published by them.  There is also a big bookstore on the corner with a great children book section in the basement.  It is similar to Barnes and Noble but with more English authors such as Enid Blyton and ballet books on Margot Fonteyn.  I fruitlessly search everywhere in Central London for children CDs and find them instead in this bookstore.  

A flea market with fresh produce, breads, blood sausages, flowers, hardware, and delicious food lends a less stuffy and intellectual atmosphere to Oxford.  International students joyfully stuff themselves on Asian food such as steamed dumplings, satay, and fried noodles sold by mom and pop owners.

Getting to Oxford is easy.  A train from Paddington costs about $40 round-trip per person.  There are buses also from Victoria.  It takes about one hour with many interesting sights.  I see grazing sheep on the way over and a giant rainbow on the way back to Central London.  What a memorable visit.  Hats off to the British.

1/  If you visit during summer break stay at one of the university's colleges.  We stayed at Christ Church.  The rooms were huge, shared bathroom/toilet and breakfast was included.  As Oxford is a proper town, staying at a B&B may mean staying some distance from the University (and less convenient).  It also means you get access to the college grounds and halls that are off limits to tourists.

2/  Do a free walking tour of Oxford University (note you can tip the tour guide how much you think it is worth at the end).  The meeting point is on the main high street.

3/  Have a go at Punting - we got a boat at Magdalen Bridge boat house, and the route was just the right length for punting newbies.  You can also park the boats along the way and have a picnic to get your strength back.

4/  Food/Drink: Turf tavern - cute pub hidden down a lane way..has outdoor area.  Al-Andalus tapas - very good Spanish tapas.

On this occasion we stayed at Wycliffe Hall and feel I need to write a review which reflects our experience in order to balance things out. 

Firstly I need to say that nobody who chooses to book through University Rooms should be expecting 5 star accommodation. In opting for this cheap alternative to an Oxford hotel you need to be aware that you will be living in student halls and therefore experiencing Oxford in a very different, arguably more authentic way.

We had a twin room on the first floor, it was clean, spacious and adequately furnished. The location on the beautiful Banbury Road is ideal for exploring the city. This is a Theology College and the atmosphere of peace and reflection is tangible. We were able to explore at will and although I am not very religious these days I spent a good few minutes just sitting in the chapel being alone with my thoughts. 

On a practical level we were able to park our car right outside at no cost and leave it there at all times, which in Oxford is a huge bonus!

The breakfast (served 8.00am - 9.00) was more than adequate and actually an improvement on the little hotel we recently stayed in when we visited Sperlonga, a tiny Italian beach town.

All of this cost £55. I think the previous reviewer was unlucky. If you want a very different and rather lovely way of experiencing the dreaming spires then you should certainly consider Wycliffe Hall. And no I don't work there!","Wycliffe Hall","COUPLES"

For without the University Oxford would be just a small provincial market town.HOWEVER as Oxfoerd does house one of the worlds most prestigious seats of learning and has done since the 11 century It is WELL WORTH the time and visits 
Although there is a huge amount to see the university is made up of a collection of colleges and the ""Kodakcracks"" are mainly in the center of town where depending on your taste of architecture you can visit any number of wonderful courtyard and buildings.
it is worth checking with your pocket guides to visit your favourites and don't over do too many so that you can keep your memory of Oxford clean. Check when the colleges are open as during term time visits are limited especially at exam times. Autum and spring are the best times for a perfect visit however a sunny day in the winter is a memorable time with the winter sunshine putting the buildings in a special setting.

"3","2015-05-19","OTHER","5","I am a resident of Oxford and hence have quite a close interaction with the University. A question I am often asked is ""Can you please direct me to the University?"". The answer is that the University is all around you in Oxford. If it has a centre it is certainly NOT Wellington Square but rather Radcliffe Square. In the centre is the iconic Radcliffe Camera (part of the University library). The square is bounded by the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, All Souls College, The Bodlian Library, part of the grounds of Exeter College and Braesnose College.
Unlike Cambridge, Oxford Colleges tend to be hidden away behind massive wooden doors with smaller entries inset. Many (but not all) encourage visitors to the major rooms (chapel and hall).
The largest college, Christchurch is particularly popular as its hall was the setting for the Harry Potter films.
We are fortunate in Oxford in having three world class choirs at Christchurch Cathedral and New and Magdalen Colleges. Attend a service at onf these and experience a free concert. Other colleges welcome the public to their Sunday Services where there tends to be a high quality amateur choral experience.
For those interested in more recent history, the top deck of the number three bus to Rose Hill gives a great view of the Iffley Road University Sports Ground where Roger Bannister ran the first sub four minute mile. Henley Street or Greyfriars is the stop immediately after the track.","Often underappreciated","COUPLES"

"15","2015-04-29","OTHER","5","The University of Oxford is truly one of the great treasures not just of England, but the world. In the centre there is a wealth of architectural glory, spanning six or seven centuries. Many of the colleges are quite small, creating an intimate atmosphere. Each has a garden, which is a haven for undergraduates especially during Trinity term, when most of the exams take place. I would like to suggest the following tour, which takes in just some of the many splendours.

If walking from the railway station, I suggest coming up George Street, and then walking down Broad Street (aka The Broad), home to colleges such as Balliol and Trinity. On the other side is the Sheldonian Theatre. The Broad is also home to the world famous Blackwells bookshop - a must for any student. Near to the Sheldonian is the remarkable Bodleian Library (aka The Bod), which is one of the oldest in the world, and second largest in Britain, after the British Library. Part of the library is the Radcliffe Camera, the circular building with the large dome which dominates this part of Oxford.

After visitng the Bodleian, I suggest walking down Catte Street. Here on the left are Hertford and All Souls college, while on the right near the end of the Street is the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. Just past the church one reaches the High Street (The High). Here one can walk down past Queen's College on one side, and University College on the other, towards Magdalen Bridge and College. 

However, I would recommend first crossing the High, and walking down the narrow Magpie Lane. This leads onto the cobbled Merton Street. At the right-hand end of this street is the grand Christ Church college, whose space seems large enough to fit in three or four other colleges. Amongst the noteworthy buildings in Christ Church is the Tom Tower, and the rather small cathedral. Next to Christ Church is the much smaller Corpus Christi college, which was built on land leased from Merton College. Between Corpus and the mighty Merton Chapel runs the Grove Walk, which leads down to Christ Church Meadow and the River.

However, for my money the most interesting college in the University is Merton. It was founded in 1264, and is the oldest college with statutes. It contains buildings from medieval times to the 20th century. Mob Quad, near to the Chapel, is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in the world, although Front Quad (which is an irregular shape) must be older. The Chapel, although majestically imposing, was never actually finished, as the land upon which most of the nave and the West front would have been built was leased off for Corpus Christi to be built. The Chapel has magnificent acoustics - many recordings have been made there. Anyone familiar with the Inspector Morse and Lewis series would recognise the stately quarter-hour chimes from the bell tower. Merton also has a very fine college garden.

Leaving Merton, one can then proceed eastwards down Merton Street, which then turns quite sharply northwards, past the Eastgate hotel, back onto the High. Backing onto the Rose Lane Buildings of Merton College is the University of Oxford Botanic Garden - which is the oldest botanic garden in Britain, and an ideal place in which to relax.

I first visited Oxford in the 1960's, when all of the buildings were blackened with soot and other kinds of pollution. I found it all very grand, but rather forbidding. However, since the 1970's nearly all of the stone has been cleaned or replaced, allowing one to enjoy ists gorgeous golden honey colour.","Such a fabulous concentration of history - not even Cambridge can rival it!","COUPLES"

Colleges generally open for external viewing with some internal opportunities in Christ Church and the Bodleian. Worth checking out some of the less well-known colleges too - like St Peter's, my old college, on New Inn Hall Street - it's only 18th Century but it's unpretentious and if you walk in during term time you get some authentic idea of working college. Round the corner in St Martin's Street is the Oxford Union - not my favourite place as a student since it's a private club rather than a student union but it has historical significance. Nice idea to go past Corpus Christi and Merton after Christ Church and walk through Port Meadow at the back down to the river. Glorious view of the spires on a crisp Autumn or Spring morning, especially on a Sunday. Ever-present crowds of loud and gobby French/Italian/Spanish students, oblivious to the rest of humankind, seem to permanently inhabit Cornmarket so avoid them.

You can see many at Magdalen College, Magdalen Tower; and the Bodleian Library [even Tweedledum & Tweedledee];  Others are at New College; St John’s College; Balliol College; Merton College; St John’s and many other campuses and buildings.                 
  
So what is a grotesque? Well, I looked it up.

The definition of “grotesque” [when used as a noun - as opposed to an adjective] as given online by the Oxford Dictionaries – Language Matters follows: 

<“ 1A very ugly or comically distorted figure, creature, or image”>  

My favorite grotesques at Oxford University are at Balliol College. I think of them as being cute [like a bulldog], haughty little creatures and, as the definition says, they could be viewed as being “ugly and comically distorted.”    

The photos posted here [or that should be posted shortly] are of grotesques that are on the wall of the New Library building facing toward the Front Quadrangle of Balliol College.  In the visitor guide to the college these grotesques are said, to represent, “academic life at Balliol in Medieval times.”  I don’t doubt that at all and I imagine that today they may still represent academic life at Balliol [no disrespect intended] .

I found very little information about these cute little figures [grotesques].  I suspect that information is there if you know where to look.  I can’t help but wonder...
1.	Do they have individual names - like the seven dwarfs of Snow White fame? Or like Tweedledum and Tweedledee do at the Bodleian Library
2.	Were they shown on the buildings architectural drawings or were they added later?
	-If so, by whom and in what capacity?
3.	When did they first appear? 
4.	How many of the 39 or so Colleges have six or more grotesques [or twelve or more]? and of course which Colleges are they?","Oxford University Grotesques","COUPLES"

We had a small amount of time to look around & shop also.  The streets were quite interesting as so many were round cobblestone.  I will have to say they didn't walk too well however!

However, if you are going to make the trip, I would suggest a guided tour. There is so much to see, and the town is rather large for a tourist to catch it all.

The Bodleian Library is a must see, and the narrow side-streets and cobbled roads throughout will make you feel like you've stepped through the pages of a history book.

Dominated by Christ Church Cathedral, the college has a number of gardens and pathways, a library and best of all, the Great Hall, where Harry Potter (among others) made famous. The Summer Study program itself is wonderful. The courses (each one week in length) are varied, very interesting and, from participants' reports, all are taught extremely well by ""tutors."" Meals are included and very elaborate, and taken in the Great Hall, where one night a week, participants are invited to preside over dinner from the High Table. In addition to classes, the Oxford Experience includes excursions in the afternoon and talks in the evening after dinner. The talk on exhuming the remains of Richard III was fascinating.

"2","2014-06-14","OTHER","5","There is no such thing as Oxford University!  In this wonderful city there are two 'so called' universities. One called 'Brookes' is a former technical college which was elevated to university status some years ago along with others in the country.  The second is a group of colleges which make up Oxford University in much the same way that Cambridge is organised.  Each college has autonomy over its affairs.  There are Examination rooms which they share as well as the Sheldonian theatre where degrees are conferred at the end of the academic year.
Although you can buy such things as sweatshirts / t-shirts etc. with Oxford University written on them, no self respecting student would buy one and simply shows that you are not a real student!
Oxford as a city is a vastly different place between 'town and gown'.  It is always very busy, when the University students are not in residence, the language students take their place although some study all year round. Tourists also now frequent the city all year round.  Each college has a special dining room which is hired out on occasions to other organisations and it is quite special if you are able to enjoy a dinner in one of these with the beautiful portraits on the walls, the silver vessels and cutlery and wonderful food.  To be able to study in these prestigious buildings must inspire the students to achieve great things.
Having had links with both Oxford and Cambridge, I cannot say that one is better than the other, it depends on what you study, who accepts you and a personal preference.  Cambridge has a more rural setting and is smaller than Oxford whereas Oxford has an industrial heritage as well.
Sadly, Oxford is not as careful as Cambridge in preserving its heritage.  For example, a McDonald's restaurant in Cambridge is only allowed to display a tiny crest to show what it is whereas the McDonald's in Oxford has a garish large emblazoned frontage right in the centre of the city.  There have also been some controversial decisions in architecture made by the City council and the colleges are also to blame for some of these designs.  That aside, both Universities have a river, the Thames or Isis in Oxford and the Cam in Cambridge and punting is to be enjoyed in both.  They also have fine museums and a botanical garden. Oxford 'University' is certainly one of the most important places to visit for a tourist and is along the main route - London - Oxford - Stratford on Avon with Blenheim Palace a short distance from Oxford.     
The colleges are the Crown Jewels of Oxford and the famous Covered Market is one extra jewel for the shopping area right in the centre which is easy to miss and is where many of the colleges buy their fresh produce!","What University?","COUPLES"

Visit another college (Magdalen was my favorite, followed by Balliol/Keble) and save your money, then walk through Christ Church meadow for free. The other bonus is that while Christ Church will be swarming with tour groups of Asian and European children, the other colleges are almost entirely vacant.","Great College, but skip Christ Church","FRIENDS"

We visited on Good Friday and tried to look round the Cathedral, but were greeted with a stare by a particularly snooty security guard  (perhaps an Oxford poly man with a chip on his shoulder) who told us that the Cathedral was closed 'all day' and that there were 'signs everywhere'. 

There were certainly signs saying it was 'open' between 1pm and 4pm for 'services and prayers' but no mention of it being closed at any time, before during or after that period. Certainly not a very welcoming Christian attitude anyway...or perhaps it should have been expected.

After inspecting the largely disappointing Harry Potter room (let's be honest, that's why people go - it's essentially a student canteen full of some quite interesting paintings) we attempted to make the visit last a bit longer by looking around the picture gallery...which would have cost another £4. Not being prepared to pay that, we left after staying no more than about half an hour in total.

The trip to Oxford Castle the next day was only three quid more and took up a fun and interesting three hours, assisted by helpful and friendly staff.

If you want to see a College, I'd suggest Balliol. It looks much the same from the outside, and the security guards may well have an equally inflated sense of their own self importance, but you won't feel so aggrieved as you'll only be shelling out a much more reasonable £2.","Christchurch College","COUPLES"

"0","2013-12-01","OTHER","5","Visitors to Oxford (of all religions and none) are welcome to attend Choral Evensong services which are held in several Oxford Colleges during term time.  During 2014, Hilary Term is 19 Jan - 15 Mar; Trinity Term is 27 Apr - 21 June; and Michaelmas Term is 12 Oct - 6 Dec. 
Choral Evensong is a service devised in the 16th century by Thomas Cranmer (Archbishop of Canterbury) for the Church of England after it had broken from Rome.  Queen Mary Tudor had him burned as a heretic. (He was tried in the University Church, in the High Street, and burned in Broad Street outside Balliol College).
Choral Evensong has inspired many beautiful musical settings of Cranmer's words.  This sort of exquisite music, normally in four-voice harmony, is rarely performed in concert.  One has to attend a Church of England service to hear it.
Choral Evensong typically takes about 40 minutes on weekdays and just under an hour on Sundays.  Entrance is free, even to casual visitors.
New College; Magdelen College and Christ Church Cathedral have boys' choir schools attached and use boy trebles. They are world famous.
In recent years, under full-time professional direction, The Queen's College and Merton College have both developed mixed-voice choirs (using women undergraduates as sopranos instead of boys as trebles) with stunning results.  They also both now do commercial recordings and tour internationally.
I have come to much prefer the sound of the mixed-voice choirs with the rich and powerful soprano voices of their 20-year-old women.
The Queen's College is unique in that its Chapel was rebuilt in 1719 to be very warm and welcoming as well as visually attractive.  The other choirs sing in awesome medieval buildings, but which are rather dark and require coats in cold weather.
Colleges tend to hold their Choral Evensong services at around 6 pm - often a little later on weekdays and a little earlier on Sundays.  Times can be found online or by contacting the Porters' Lodge of a College.
For a visitor, attending a Choral Evensong service is NOT merely being shown round as a tourist, it is to take an active part in a University tradition. And don't worry about knowing when to sit down or stand up, or when to join in prayers or singing a hymn; the Chaplain explains things or you just copy your neighbours in the pews.","Attend A Choral Service In A College Chapel","FRIENDS"

It was a good visit apart from the incredibly rude attitude from the staff - first of all from the older man at the door when we arrived at exactly 4.20pm (doors close at 4.30 pm). He kept griping about ¨these bloody tourists, they all come when I want to go"", and he was shouting at a group of Russian students in front of us to move so he could bolt the door. Outside the cathedral, a pair of Chinese students wandered off to a restricted area and one female guard did such a carry on that a Lone Ranger persecution wouldn´t have been as amusing. She shouted at them, threatened to call the police - all they did was to wander off in distraction! I did it myself, and said woman snapped at me - she could probably see I am fluent in English and could probably complain about her. Which I would have done, had I not been travelling with 3 young children and forgotten to take her and the old man at the entrance´s names. 

Although I am not British by birth, I am by naturalisation and the attitude you find in tourist places makes me very sad. Yes, it is hard work to deal with thousands of tourists day in and day out, but if these people hate their jobs so much, they should be looking for something else.

To find your way around the various colleges, several walking tours are offered (check with the helpful Information Center on Broad St). However, my wife and I found it fun to wander through the college lanes, getting lost on occasion but absorbing the beauty of the architecture, the charm of the students hurrying about (some in graduation black gowns at the time), and popping into whichever building we came upon that was open to the public. You can get a Visitor's Guide at the Information Center that includes a nice walking tour of its own, which we followed to the lovely water meadows below Merton College and down the winding lanes of Queen's College. Open hours for the various colleges vary quite a bit, as do the hours for some of the better known sites such as the Bodleian Library and the Sheldonian Theatre.

Unfortunately the University has sullied it reputation recently with shoddy and insensitive buildings on the edge of Port Meadow. For those who don't know Port Meadow, it has never been ploughed, it contains well preserved archaeological remains, some of which survive as residual earthworks. Of particular note are several Bronze Age round barrows, an area of Iron Age settlement, and the foundations of 17th-century fortifications from the Parliamentary siege of Oxford during the English Civil War. More importantly, it is the green lungs of Oxford and hugely responsible for preventing an annual flood of the city.
While I'd like to rate the University very highly, I can't. It is undoubtedly a fantastic place to visit but the arrogance and greed of the university have made it lose the plot completely.

Most of the tours that you will book online, or once you arrive there will depart from Victoria Coach Station.  My travel companion (who purchased this for me) and I were fortunate to be staying at Trafalgar square, which is walking distance to the London Toursit Info center, a courtesy pick up point for the tour company with which we went.    
You start your day with an early pick up, in order to be at the Coach station for an on time 9am departure.  Then it is a 1 1/2 hour ridfe up to Oxford and the University.  We had a great Guide and Driver, who was funny, witty and knowledable, and this made a GREAT difference in the experience.  She was also equipped with the ""Whisper"" device, that allowed her to talk to us as a group without shouting, and giving us constant info as we walked through the college(s).  Even though I am not a dire Harry Potter fan, it was still ""cool"" to see the inspiration for the lunch room, and to know that it is still a working lunch room.  If you are NOT familiar with Lewis Carroll before you go, bone up on him and the Alice story, so that the whole experience will be more meaningful to you.
And for my American readers, one can understand why our former President and his daughter liked the school..
Regarding souvenirs, where we stopped for a break were a few stores, and both had stuff on sale.  The sweat shirts were a great bargain.  
Also, everyone (all the tour and non-tour people) head for the cafe's opposite the school of Music...and the lines get long.

First, the travel in the red double-deckers from Victoria Coach Station to Oxford is an exhilarating experience.  The buses are very very comfortable - especially in the top deck -- and coursing through the lush green countryside gives you a feel of authentic England.

Once in Oxford, the best is to take hop-in hop-off. Remember, in Oxford, the university is the town unlike Cambridge. At the oldest university in the world, must-see colleges are Magdalen, Balliol, St Anthony's and Trinity. The hop-in hop-off takes about an hour for a full circle with very informative commentary.   

We got down at the really historical Blackwell bookshop which traces its roots alongside Oxford. You have books, books and books and can spend a lifetime. We spent some time here reading and having black coffee at the wonderful cafe. My daughter, who loves Greek mythology, bought a book but the advise she got on what to buy was stupendous...

Right next to Blackwell is the Trinity College and the road winds down to one of the busy streets right in middle of the town -- dotted with restaurants and shops. Bodelyan library, no introduction needed, is just opposite Blackwells.

"18","2012-06-24","OTHER","4","Don't miss the Bridge of Sighs, which comes up out of nowhere as you walk the back alleys; Radcliffe Camera, which is almost impossible to miss given it's height and location; the Bodleian Library, which is next to Radcliffe Camera and somewhat unpresumptiously holds a copy of every book ever printed (on 100 miles of shelving); the view of Christ Church from the gardens; the somewhat tucked away and hidden Saxon Tower of St. Michael, which is one of the oldest buildings there; the climb to the top of Carfax Tower to get an aerial view of the city. 

It's fairly easy to walk through all of these in about 90 minutes, but you can easily spend three hours if you also enter the colleges and see their interiors, or dedicate additional time, for example, at Carfax Tower.

Some practicalities:

- From the train station, take a taxi to the visitor's center on Broad Street. It'll cost under 5 pounds one-way and you'll save yourself a kilometer's walk. Do the same thing on the return to the station. From the visitor's center you can do a mostly square shaped walk around most of what there is to see.

- Do go into the visitor's center and purchase a one pound Oxford Visitor's Guide. It's a small booklet that contains directions for a very good walking tour which will take around 90 minutes to do on your own.

- Avoid the group walking tours and do the self-walk from the visitor's guide (above). These group tours are offered by several businesses as well as from the visitor's center, but they are only offered with start times from around 11:00 to 14:00, cost 8 pounds per person, can only be booked for a specific time (use it or lose it) and still last around 90 minutes.

- Arrive before 17:00 as that is when the colleges close their doors to visitors. It's also when the visitor's center closes. Do go into at least of couple of colleges to see their architectural interiors and designs. Every college has their own chapel (or in the case of Christ Church College, their own cathedral).

- If you get hungry (snack hungry) around mid-way through the self-guided walking tour, stop over at Patisserie Valerie at 90 High Street close to Catte Street. They have the most wonderful waffle desserts and cakes (at a somewhat high price, but well worth it).
 
Consider making Oxford a half day visit combined with the other half of the day at Windsor Castle. There are trains that connect the two cities departing around every 30 minutes for a 55 minute ride that has a stopover at Slough. Windsor does their changing of the guard every day at 11:00 except Sundays when there is none, and they open the castle between 9:45 and 10:00 depending on month of the year. You can then see Windsor in the morning and see Oxford in mid-afternoon while getting back to London around 20:00. Note that trains on these routes do not have reserved seats.","A great half day visit to a historic university town","FAMILY"

"18","2012-04-04","OTHER","5","During term time, several Oxford Colleges hold Choral Evensongs in their Chapels on various evenings during the week.  
The beautiful service (lasting about 45 minutes) was written by Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury who, during Mary Tudor's reign, was tried for heresy in the University Church and burned to death in Broad Street.
Cranmer's Evensong Service has inspired countless beautiful musical settings - far more even than the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein II or Stephen Sondheim!
Three colleges - New College, Magdalen College and Christ Church have their own choir schools which provide boy trebles.  I prefer the thrilling sound of the 28-strong mixed-voice choir at The Queen's College, with its 20-year-old sopranos (who sing on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays).
They are all wonderful; entry is free; all are welcome; just ask at the Porters' Lodge of the college.
It will be a personal and unforgettable experience to recount to those back at home.","Choral Evensong - during term time - magic and free.","SOLO"
"3","2012-04-01","OTHER","4","Perhaps because I am a university professor, I found that visiting some of the colleges at Oxford was a tedious and frustrating experience. 
I had the feeling at each of the colleges I visited with my family - my wife, son and daughter-in-law - that visitors were regarded as a nuisance to be either tolerated, or tolerated and exploited for visitors fees that only entitled the visitors to very limited access to the colleges, for what seemed to me to be an unwarranted entry fee.
I felt this way at Christ Church, King's, Merton and Magdalen Colleges. At New College we were turned away with the explanation that a conference was being held at the college that afternoon, but visitors would be welcome the next afternoon. When we returned the next afternoon, we were told the same thing.
We were able to view the special exhibit of medieval manuscripts - several of them magnificently illuminated -  at the Bodelian Library. The kindness and courtesy of the library staff contrasted with the disinterest of the colleges 'gatekeepers'. 
It is entirely understandable that the educational and scholarly purposes of the colleges should take precedence over the interests of visitors attracted by the history and architecture of the historic colleges of Oxford, but for people who come to Oxford during a period when students are on a holiday break - as was the case when we visited - perhaps there could be a greater open-ness and welcome to visitors when they are paying admission fees to visit the college campuses.","historic places, frustrating visiting hours","FAMILY"

"1","2012-01-30","OTHER","4","I shouldn't say that because it will come across in a very misanthropic way, but the best time to visit the University of Oxford is in the summer, because there aren't crowds of students.  And conversely, the students won't be troubled by crowds of tourists.

The University is a rather vague concept; there's not a single campus to visit (although half the city is made up of university buildings) but instead there's all the different colleges, libraries and museums that you can peer at.  Some of these august seats of learning will let you in to have a look.  Others won't - after all, this is an establishment that is doing its best to cram information into young minds, so it probably wouldn't help somebody panicking about the niceties of modal logic to have you snapping away at her with a camera.

Best photo opportunities, of course, are during the summer when it's still term time, but only if you're fond of schadenfreude.  Although it may seem quaint to photograph somebody dressed like a penguin in a gown sprinting down the High Street, please remember that the poor thing is running to an exam that may decide the course of their adult life.
